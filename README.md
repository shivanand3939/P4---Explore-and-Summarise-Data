Prosper Loan Data

Explore Prosper Loan Data

In all this dataset contains 113937 records of 81 variables. The data is provided by Udacity as a part of Explore and Summarize Data.
The data contains information on ListingCreationDate, Loan Amount, Listing Details, ProsperScore, EstimatedReturn, Borrower Employment details, Borrowers Credit history,
Number of Investors. The complete list of variables and their description can be found in variablesDescription file

Before looking at the data I was keen on exploring the following questions
1) From an Investor perspective, which loan attributes affects EstimatedReturn
2) Which attributes contribute more to Loan defaults/Chargedoffs.
3) Number of Investors vs each Loan. Is there any correlation between Number of Investors vs loan defaults. 
It could be a good parameter of Investors behaviour
